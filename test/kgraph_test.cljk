;; Added 2026-08-18 with the `.clj` -> `.cljc` conversion. The suite that was
;; here measured four assertions, which is not enough to notice a conversion
;; going wrong: a rename plus a green run on four assertions is a claim, not
;; evidence. Each of these was written against an invariant in the source
;; before the mutation table was run, and the mutation table records which of
;; them actually catch what.
