;;
;; ## Why this exists
;;
;; `kotoba.kgraph` requires `datom.core`, which lives in another repository
;; and is pinned by `:git/sha` in `deps.edn`. nbb has no dependency resolver:
;; a classpath is a startup argument, so something has to turn that pin into
;; a directory. Writing the sha into the run command by hand works exactly
;; until `deps.edn` moves and the command silently keeps testing the old
;; checkout — so the sha is READ FROM `deps.edn`, never retyped.
;;
;; The output is absolute because the point of `test/run_portable.cljs` is to
;; be run from a directory that is not this repo. A relative classpath is
;; right in the one place that was already working.
;;
;; If the pinned checkout is not in `~/.gitlibs` this CLONES it there, rather
;; than reporting a classpath that does not resolve. Nothing else here
;; touches the network.
